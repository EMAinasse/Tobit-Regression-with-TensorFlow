# Tobit Regression with TensorFlow
This is an implemention of Tobit Regression with TensorFlow v1 based on one of the assignments for the course "A Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance" (NYU) on Coursera.

We test apply the regression method to generated data, and we then we apply a linear regression model and neural network model to non-linear data to see how neural networks help to overcome non-linearities in the data.

Further details can be found in the Jupyer notebook.
